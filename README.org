* XGBoost.swift
A new coming Swift interface for [[https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost][XGBoost]].

The current interface is wrapping around the C API of XGBoost version 1.1.0.

** Installation
Tested only under MacOS 10.15 with =brew install xgboost=. The C header file and
 library are located through =pkg-config=. Readme through the following links 
 for detail.

- [[https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/Usage.md#requiring-system-libraries][swift-package-manager]] 
- [[https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html#module-map-language][Clang Module Map Language]]
- [[https://people.freedesktop.org/~dbn/pkg-config-guide.html][Guide to pkg-config]]

** Usage
*Still in early development, use with caution.*
#+begin_src rust
let train = DMatrix(filename: "data/agaricus.txt.train")
let test = DMatrix(filename: "data/agaricus.txt.test")

let bst = XGBoost(data: train, numRound: 10)
bst.predict(data: test)
#+end_src

** TODOs
- [ ] Proper memory management
- [ ] Better error handling
- [ ] Support more data representation models
